# Boston Voter App

# Description
The Boston Voter App addresses the lack of accessible information about voting logistics and candidates in municipal elections in Boston. This progressive web application centralizes all vital voting information to increase voter turnout, particularly focusing on BIPOC voters who face significant barriers to voting in local elections. It also provides them features like finding their nearest polling booth locations, and information about upcoming elections, helping in reducing these barriers.
