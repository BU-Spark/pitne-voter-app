# Boston Voter App

# Description
The Boston Voter App addresses the lack of accessible information about voting logistics and candidates in municipal elections in Boston. This progressive web application centralizes all vital voting information to increase voter turnout, particularly focusing on BIPOC voters who face significant barriers to voting in local elections. 

# Problem Statement
Many news organizations provide articles or voting guides around the election, but they are often difficult to find, last minute, and represent a narrow perspective around candidates. Additionally, most election resources are around larger races with little coverage or few resources available for local elections, where candidates have the potential to impact peopleâ€™s lives more directly. BIPOC voters often have the lowest voting rates, especially in municipal elections, for a variety of reasons including lack of information and logistical barriers such as work hours and family duties. This project aims to remedy that for BIPOC voters in Boston.

# Solution
The Boston Voter App provides a comprehensive solution by offering:

* Centralized voting information for Boston municipal elections.
* Detailed candidate profiles, information about them and ballot initiatives.
* Voting logistics including polling locations and hours.
* Features to find the nearest polling booth locations.
* Information about upcoming elections.
* Tools and resources to help voters navigate logistical barriers, ultimately aiming to increase BIPOC voter turnout.
